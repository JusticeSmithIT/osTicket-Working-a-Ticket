<br />
<br />
Select the SLA plan tab under the "Assigned to" tab, this is where you will assign type of SLA. In this case you will assign as "Sev-A" which is the highest priority because online banking is down, and that disrupts the functioning of the business.   <br/>

Assign it to one of the teams you created earlier. This is an online banking issue so you will assign it to the online banking team.  <br/>

In the ticket thread, post what your suspsicions are as to why online banking is down. The user can see this reply. In a real setting you would keep them updated with the process througout the day. <br/>
